// Write a program to replace each cell value in a list with another value which is its average with its next element
// Last element is replaced with its average with itself and first element in the source list
// DO NOT create another list, but modify the elements of the given list
// For eg : L1 = 40,60,80,50,10,30
//			L2 = 50,70,65,30,20,35
